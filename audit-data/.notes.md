## About the Project

**SpookySwap** is a Halloween-themed decentralized application where users can participate in a thrilling "Trick or Treat" experience! Swap ETH for special Halloween-themed NFT treats. But beware, you might get tricked! There's a small chance your treat will cost half the price, or you might have to pay double. Collect rare NFTs, trade them with friends, or hold onto them for spooky surprises. Will you be tricked or treated?

### Actors

* **Owner/Admin (Trusted)** - Can add new treats, set treat costs, and withdraw collected fees.
* **User/Participant** - Can swap ETH for Halloween treat NFTs, experience "Trick or Treat", and trade NFTs with others.


Potential vulnerabilites:
- refund works if it is a user.
- what if the user is a contract? with no receive or fallback?

## Summary

The `SpookySwap` smart contract emits the `Swapped` event incorrectly when a user doesn't send enough ETH during a "trick" scenario. Specifically, the contract mints the NFT to itself (`address(this)`) but emits the `Swapped` event as if the user (`msg.sender`) received the NFT. This misleads users and off-chain systems into believing that the NFT has been transferred to the user when it hasn't. The issue lies in the event emission timing and the incorrect recipient address in the event parameters.

## Vulnerability Details

### **Issue Overview**

In the `trickOrTreat` function, when the `costMultiplierNumerator` is `2` and `costMultiplierDenominator` is `1`, the contract handles the "double price" case (a trick). If the user doesn't send enough ETH (`msg.value < requiredCost`), the contract mints the NFT to itself and stores pending purchase details. However, it incorrectly emits the `Swapped` event with `msg.sender` as the recipient, suggesting that the NFT has been transferred to the user.

### **Affected Code**

```solidity
if (costMultiplierNumerator == 2 && costMultiplierDenominator == 1) {
    // Double price case (trick)
    if (msg.value >= requiredCost) {
        // User sent enough ETH
        mintTreat(msg.sender, treat);
    } else {
        // User didn't send enough ETH
        // Mint NFT to contract and store pending purchase
        uint256 tokenId = nextTokenId;
        _mint(address(this), tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, treat.metadataURI);
        nextTokenId += 1;

        pendingNFTs[tokenId] = msg.sender;
        pendingNFTsAmountPaid[tokenId] = msg.value;
        tokenIdToTreatName[tokenId] = _treatName;

        // Incorrect event emission
        emit Swapped(msg.sender, _treatName, tokenId);

        // User needs to call fellForTrick() to finish the transaction
    }
}
```

### **Problem Explanation**

- **Incorrect Recipient in Event:** The `Swapped` event is emitted with `msg.sender` as the recipient, even though the NFT is minted to `address(this)`, not to the user.
- **Misleading Event Timing:** Emitting the event at this point suggests that the NFT transfer to the user is complete, which is not the case. The user must call `fellForTrick()` to finalize the transfer.
- **Potential for Confusion:** Users and off-chain systems relying on the `Swapped` event may incorrectly assume the NFT is in the user's possession.

## Impact

- **User Confusion:** Users might believe they own the NFT and attempt actions like transferring or interacting with it, leading to failed transactions.
- **Misrepresentation in Off-Chain Systems:** Wallets, explorers, and dApps that track events may display inaccurate ownership information.
- **Operational Integrity Issues:** The misleading event undermines the trust in the contract's reliability and transparency.

**Severity Classification:** **Low**

While the issue can cause confusion and minor inconvenience, it doesn't lead to financial loss, security breaches, or significant disruption of the contract's functionality. Users can still complete the process by calling `fellForTrick()`, and no assets are at risk.

## Tools Used

- **Manual Code Review:** Carefully examined the contract's logic and event emissions.
- **Testing with Hardhat:** Deployed the contract locally to simulate the scenario and observe the emitted events.
- **Solidity Debugging Tools:** Used console logs and debugging statements to trace the execution flow.

## Recommendations

1. **Adjust the Event Emission:**

   - **Update the Recipient Address:**
     Change the `emit Swapped` statement to reflect the correct recipient (`address(this)`).

     ```solidity
     emit Swapped(address(this), _treatName, tokenId);
     ```

   - **Or Emit a Different Event:**
     Emit a new event to indicate that the NFT is pending and the user needs to take further action.

     ```solidity
     event TrickInitiated(address indexed user, string treatName, uint256 tokenId);

     emit TrickInitiated(msg.sender, _treatName, tokenId);
     ```

2. **Emit the `Swapped` Event After Transfer Completion:**

   Move the `emit Swapped` event to the `fellForTrick()` function, which finalizes the NFT transfer to the user.

   ```solidity
   function fellForTrick(uint256 tokenId) external payable {
       // ... existing logic ...

       // Transfer the NFT to the user
       _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);

       // Emit the event now that the user owns the NFT
       emit Swapped(msg.sender, tokenIdToTreatName[tokenId], tokenId);
   }
   ```

3. **Improve User Guidance:**

   - **In-Contract Messaging:**
     Provide clear messages in `require` statements to inform users about the need to call `fellForTrick()`.

     ```solidity
     require(msg.value >= requiredCost, "Insufficient ETH. Complete the trick by calling fellForTrick().");
     ```

   - **Documentation and UI Updates:**
     Ensure that user interfaces and documentation clearly explain the process, including any additional steps required.

4. **Implement Safe Minting Practices:**

   - **Use `_safeMint` Instead of `_mint`:**
     Replace `_mint` with `_safeMint` to ensure that NFTs are only minted to addresses capable of handling them.

     ```solidity
     _safeMint(address(this), tokenId);
     ```

   - **Implement `IERC721Receiver` Interface:**
     If the contract needs to receive NFTs, it should implement the `IERC721Receiver` interface.

     ```solidity
     contract SpookySwap is ERC721, IERC721Receiver {
         function onERC721Received(
             address operator,
             address from,
             uint256 tokenId,
             bytes calldata data
         ) external override returns (bytes4) {
             return this.onERC721Received.selector;
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Test Event Emissions Thoroughly:**

   - Write unit tests to ensure events are emitted accurately and at the correct time.
   - Verify that off-chain systems interpret the events as intended.

By implementing these recommendations, the `SpookySwap` contract will provide clearer communication to users and off-chain systems, enhancing user experience and maintaining trust in the platform.

### [S-1] Missing Event Emission After NFT Transfer (Event Not Emitted Causes Inconsistent State Tracking)

---

## Summary

In the `resolveTrick` function of the `SpookySwap` contract, after successfully transferring an NFT from the contract to the user, the contract fails to emit the `Swapped` event. This omission can lead to off-chain systems and users not being aware of the NFT transfer, causing inconsistencies between the on-chain state and external perceptions. The lack of event emission affects user experience and the reliability of applications that rely on these events to update NFT ownership statuses.

## Vulnerability Details

### Issue Overview

When a user calls the `resolveTrick` function to complete their purchase (after initially not paying enough during a "trick" scenario), the contract correctly transfers the NFT to the user. However, it does not emit the `Swapped` event to signal this transfer. Events are crucial for off-chain applications like wallets and explorers to track token movements and update user balances.

### Affected Code

```solidity
function resolveTrick(uint256 tokenId) public payable nonReentrant {
    require(pendingNFTs[tokenId] == msg.sender, "Not authorized to complete purchase");

    string memory treatName = tokenIdToTreatName[tokenId];
    Treat memory treat = treatList[treatName];

    uint256 requiredCost = treat.cost * 2; // Double price
    uint256 amountPaid = pendingNFTsAmountPaid[tokenId];
    uint256 totalPaid = amountPaid + msg.value;

    require(totalPaid >= requiredCost, "Insufficient ETH sent to complete purchase");

    // Transfer the NFT to the buyer
    _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);

    // Clean up storage
    delete pendingNFTs[tokenId];
    delete pendingNFTsAmountPaid[tokenId];
    delete tokenIdToTreatName[tokenId];

    // Refund excess ETH if any
    if (totalPaid > requiredCost) {
        uint256 refund = totalPaid - requiredCost;
        (bool refundSuccess, ) = msg.sender.call{value: refund}("");
        require(refundSuccess, "Refund failed");
    }
}
```

### Problem Explanation

- **Missing Event Emission:** After transferring the NFT to the user using `_transfer(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);`, the function does not emit the `Swapped` event or any equivalent event to indicate the successful transfer.
- **Impact on Off-Chain Systems:** Off-chain services that rely on event logs to update NFT ownership will not detect this transfer, leading to outdated or incorrect information displayed to users.
- **User Confusion:** Users may not see their newly acquired NFT in wallets or platforms immediately, causing confusion and potential mistrust in the system.

## Impact

- **Inaccurate Off-Chain Data:** Wallets, explorers, and other applications may fail to update the user's NFT holdings, as they rely on emitted events to track changes.
- **User Experience Degradation:** Users might believe the transaction failed or is pending, leading to unnecessary support requests or negative perceptions of the platform.
- **Operational Integrity:** The contract's reliability is undermined when standard practices like event emissions are not consistently followed.

**Severity Classification:** **Low**

While the NFT transfer occurs correctly on-chain, the missing event affects the user experience and the accuracy of off-chain data. It does not, however, lead to a loss of funds, security vulnerabilities, or critical disruptions in contract functionality.

## Tools Used

- **Manual Code Review:** Analyzed the `resolveTrick` function to identify the absence of event emission after the NFT transfer.
- **Testing Frameworks:** Utilized testing tools like Hardhat or Foundry to simulate transactions and observe emitted events.
- **Blockchain Explorers:** Monitored contract interactions to confirm that the `Swapped` event is not emitted when expected.

## Recommendations

To address the issue of the missing `Swapped` event emission in the `resolveTrick` function, the following steps are recommended. The code changes are presented using a `diff` to clearly show the modifications needed.

### 1. Add the Missing `emit Swapped` Statement in `resolveTrick` Function

**Code Diff:**

```diff
function resolveTrick(uint256 tokenId) public payable nonReentrant {
    require(pendingNFTs[tokenId] == msg.sender, "Not authorized to complete purchase");

    string memory treatName = tokenIdToTreatName[tokenId];
    Treat memory treat = treatList[treatName];

    uint256 requiredCost = treat.cost * 2; // Double price
    uint256 amountPaid = pendingNFTsAmountPaid[tokenId];
    uint256 totalPaid = amountPaid + msg.value;

    require(totalPaid >= requiredCost, "Insufficient ETH sent to complete purchase");

    // Transfer the NFT to the buyer
    _transfer(address(this), msg.sender, tokenId);

+   // Emit the Swapped event to indicate successful transfer
+   emit Swapped(msg.sender, treatName, tokenId);

    // Clean up storage
    delete pendingNFTs[tokenId];
    delete pendingNFTsAmountPaid[tokenId];
    delete tokenIdToTreatName[tokenId];

    // Refund excess ETH if any
    if (totalPaid > requiredCost) {
        uint256 refund = totalPaid - requiredCost;
        (bool refundSuccess, ) = msg.sender.call{value: refund}("");
        require(refundSuccess, "Refund failed");
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Added Lines:**

  ```diff
  +   emit Swapped(msg.sender, treatName, tokenId);
  ```

  This line emits the `Swapped` event immediately after the NFT transfer to the user, ensuring that off-chain systems are notified of the transfer.

**Benefits:**

- **Accurate Event Emission:** Ensures that the event reflects the actual transfer, allowing off-chain systems to update user balances correctly.
- **Improved User Experience:** Users will see their NFT holdings updated promptly, reducing confusion and enhancing trust.

### 2. Ensure Consistent Event Emission Across All Transfer Functions

Review the entire contract to verify that all functions performing NFT transfers emit the appropriate events. This includes any other functions that might transfer NFTs to users or contracts.

**Action Steps:**

- **Audit Transfer Functions:** Identify all functions that involve NFT transfers.
- **Add Missing Events:** For any transfer operations lacking event emissions, add the necessary `emit` statements.

### 3. Thoroughly Test Event Emissions

Implement unit and integration tests to confirm that events are emitted correctly in all scenarios.

**Example Test Case:**

```solidity
function testResolveTrickEmitsSwappedEvent() public {
    // Arrange: Set up the initial conditions and perform the initial trick
    // (omitted for brevity)

    // Act: Call resolveTrick
    vm.expectEmit(true, true, true, true);
    emit Swapped(msg.sender, treatName, tokenId);
    spookySwap.resolveTrick{value: requiredCost}(tokenId);

    // Assert: Verify the NFT ownership and any other necessary checks
    assertEq(spookySwap.ownerOf(tokenId), msg.sender, "NFT ownership should be transferred to the user");
}
```

**Benefits:**

- **Verification:** Ensures that event emissions occur as expected during contract execution.
- **Reliability:** Builds confidence in the contract's behavior and consistency.

### 4. Update Documentation and Communication

Ensure that the contract's documentation reflects the updated event emissions and that users are informed about the transaction flow.

**Action Steps:**

- **Contract Documentation:** Update comments and external documentation to include information about the `Swapped` event emission in the `resolveTrick` function.
- **User Guides:** If applicable, update any user-facing materials or interfaces to explain the process and the events emitted.

### 5. Enhance User Experience in Interfaces

If your platform includes user interfaces (e.g., web apps, mobile apps), ensure they handle the updated event emissions appropriately.

**Action Steps:**

- **Update Event Listeners:** Modify the application's event listeners to listen for the `Swapped` event after `resolveTrick` is called.
- **User Feedback:** Provide users with immediate feedback that their NFT has been transferred upon successful completion of the `resolveTrick` function.

---

By implementing these recommendations, the `SpookySwap` contract will improve transparency and reliability, ensuring that users and off-chain systems are accurately informed about NFT transfers. This will enhance user trust and the overall functionality of platforms interacting with the contract.

---

**Note:** It's crucial to maintain consistency in event emissions throughout the contract to prevent similar issues elsewhere. Regular code reviews and thorough testing can help identify and rectify such oversights.
