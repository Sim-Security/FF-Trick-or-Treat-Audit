## About the Project

**SpookySwap** is a Halloween-themed decentralized application where users can participate in a thrilling "Trick or Treat" experience! Swap ETH for special Halloween-themed NFT treats. But beware, you might get tricked! There's a small chance your treat will cost half the price, or you might have to pay double. Collect rare NFTs, trade them with friends, or hold onto them for spooky surprises. Will you be tricked or treated?

### Actors

* **Owner/Admin (Trusted)** - Can add new treats, set treat costs, and withdraw collected fees.
* **User/Participant** - Can swap ETH for Halloween treat NFTs, experience "Trick or Treat", and trade NFTs with others.


Potential vulnerabilites:
- refund works if it is a user.
- what if the user is a contract? with no receive or fallback?
